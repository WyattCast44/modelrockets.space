Ah, the obligatory 'hello world' post. Everything has to start somewhere I suppose.

**_ModelRockets.Space has officially launched!_** (In a private, only me beta ðŸ¤«) I plan to announce soon, but no test like a pushing to production test!

If you read this before I officially launch, thanks for reading! I am building this forum/community as a learning experiment to polish my skills building web apps. But the further I get, the more I am loving this project!

I follow model (and real) rocketry literally constantly. Like many others, I am caught up in this new space wave, my twitter and instagram feed is filled with people 3D printing rockets, attempting to land model rockets, SpaceX blowing minds daily, and so much more.

If 2019 has taught me anything it's that's the rocketry community is alive and growing. In fact for the first time in my memory, the general population has again taken a significant interest in the field.

My hope is that this community will grow and help me keep up with this fast paced, exciting space (pun intended) Overall it is an exciting time in the Aerospace industry and that excitement and innovation is spilling over into the Model Rocketry space, and I look forward to being a part of it :)
