### CSS

I have chosen to use [TailwindCSS](https://stimulusjs.org/) as the main CSS library for this project. I have also chosen to pull in small Bootstrap components for specific uses, such as basic form styling.

### Javascript

My goal in this project is to use JS solely for progressive enchancement. This means that the app should function completely even with javascipt disabled.

I have chosen to use [StimulusJs](https://stimulusjs.org/) for handling any JS needs. I have also installed [Turbolinks]([https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks), again as an enhancement, if this gets turned off the app should still work.
