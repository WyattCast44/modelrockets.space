There is a known issue when testing publishing articles, due to technical debt, when an article is published a thead is created in the `Article Discussions` board, but if this board and the `ArticlesBot` user does not yet exist, the thread will not be created, this will lead to unforeseen and difficult problems to debug. The solution right now is just to run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` which will create the board and user.
